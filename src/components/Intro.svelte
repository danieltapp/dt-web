By day, I manage teams and wrangle code; by night, I'm a family man who occasionally finds time to build cool things in the JavaScript ecosystem. 🛠️ Whether I’m launching features into production 🚀, exploring the final frontier of side projects 🌌, or dodging the black hole of merge conflicts 🌀, I love turning ideas into reality and having a little fun along the way. 👨‍🚀";
